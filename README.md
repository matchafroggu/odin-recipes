I am going to build a basic recipe website.

I will put all the HTML knowledge I have acquired into practice in this project.

The website will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes. It won't look very pretty, mind you.

However, this project is just to build my HTML chops! I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
